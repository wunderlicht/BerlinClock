BerlinClock
===========

Pebble watch face of the great Mengenlehreuhr in my home town Berlin, Germany. During my childhood the clock was situated in the middle of the Kurf√ºrstendamm in Western Berlin. I can still remember my Mom and Dad explaining how to read the clock. My Grandma always peeked at her watch to tell the time :-)

It is quite easy once you've been told.

* The flashing dot is the seconds (it is on one second and off one second)
* The first row of rectangles are 5 hours each.
* The second row of rectangles is one hour each.
* The third row is 5 minutes each.
* The fourth row is one minute each.
* Add it all up and you got the time.

That's it.
